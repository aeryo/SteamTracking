					<div class="person_content">Michael Abrash was ABD (All But Dissertation) in the PhD program in Energy Management and Policy at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 when he got his first microcomputer – a Vector Graphics VIP CP/M machine with 56K and 160x72 graphics – and he’s still ABD. (His mother stopped giving him a hard time about not getting his PhD sometime in the mid-1990’s, right around his first meeting with Bill Gates.) He did some of the earliest arcade-style games for the IBM PC (Space Strike, Cosmic Crusader, and Big Top, if you’re a trivia buff – and yes, they were sold in plastic baggies). After he discovered the hard way that the PC didn’t actually have a game market yet, he worked at a series of hardware and software graphics companies, writing several books (including Zen of Assembly Language) and magazine columns (remember them?) on performance and graphics (most notably for Dr. Dobb’s Journal) along the way. In 1992 he somehow ended up as the graphics lead for the first two versions of Windows NT, then in 1995 he went to Id and worked alongside John Carmack to write Quake. After that he worked on both versions of Xbox, cowrote a software renderer, and worked on Intel’s Larrabee project before coming to Valve.

					<div class="person_content"> Mike has a B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology from Yale and a PhD in Psychology from the University of Illinois. His job 

description is vague, but he thinks it probably has something to do with applying both psychological knowledge and methodologies to game design. Essentially this means he gets to play with data, perform 

research, and act as an in-house consultant of sorts. He is really happy that you took the time to read his paragraph.</div>

					<div class="person_content">Matthew loved to play video games as a child. His parents warned him that playing games wasn't going to get him a job in the future. After graduating from the University of Washington in 2010, he proved them wrong by landing a job at Valve. As part of Valve’s Steam Support Team, Matthew helps support our Korean community and localizing efforts, making thousands of Korean Steam users believe we actually have offices in Korea. Matthew also uses his Photoshop skills to help make sure advertisements for sales and promotions get properly translated and presented to Steam users in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, and German - just to name a few. In his spare time he enjoys playing soccer and any first-person shooter game he can get his hands on.</div>

Then, in 1993, he was introduced to CGI at Pixar – and he really LIKED IT. For the next 12 years, Mike worked at the Walt Disney Animation Studios on such projects as <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>, <i>Meet the Robinsons</i>, and <i>Bolt</i>.

					<div class="person_content">Another Fort Walton Beach, Florida native, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 1994 and headed for California and 3Dfx Interactive. His responsibilities there included developer support, porting products to hardware, sample code, simple demos, and ultimately working with the 3Dfx developer relations team to manage the engineering game porting effort. Charlie left 3Dfx after two years and, with his college friend Gary McTaggart, created the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Not long after joining Ritual, Charlie and Gary left to start their own company. Not long after that, Valve made Charlie (and Gary) an offer "they couldn't refuse."

When that didn’t happen, and after the Internet bubble burst, he decided to forget all that web-based, e-commerce stuff and pursue his real dream: making video games. He joined Midway Games West (formerly, the original Atari). That studio shut down a few months later, so Tom moved on to Maxis where he worked on titles such as <i>Darkspore</i>, <i>Spore</i>, and <i>The Sims 2</i> (and many of its expansion packs). Since joining Valve in 2010, Tom has worked on <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Portal 2</i>, and small parts of Steam.</div>

Reach the highest rung of the internet comedy-writing ladder.

Prior to Valve, Alfred worked for an Australian research organization; he would be forced to kill anyone who discovered the true nature of his work there. He is also the one to blame for starting plug-ins on <i>Half-Life</i> servers and, in particular, for creating Admin mod.</div>

For the next 12 years he served as Lead Designer at 3DO and Double Fine Productions. Finally, in 2010, he dragged his wife up to the Pacific Northwest and took a job at Valve.</div>

Later he went on to work at Weta Digital in New Zealand where he led the Look/Development for Jake and Neytiri, the main (alien) characters in the movie “Avatar”. He also did extensive creature texture painting and worked on other movies as well, such as The Adventures of Tin Tin, where he painted and shaded the textures for Tin Tin himself, as well as the Captain. He has now been at Valve for several years doing character design and other game art related things. Although he sucks at actually playing video games, he loves working on them.</div>

She joined the company in late 2006. Since arriving, she’s done a little of everything, from character design to comic books (<i>Lab Rat</i>) to hand modeling. (Yes, Andrea is “the hand” of <i>Left 4 Dead</i>.) On her days off, she paints with real, non-electronic paint and listens to loud music—loud enough to drown out her singing voice.</div>

When <i>Half-Life 2</i> shipped in 2004, the curse that prevented games that Matt worked on from getting shipped was finally broken. Now, he helps Valve ship games often, working primarily as a level and game designer, and gameplay programmer.

After capturing far too many flags, Zoid joined Retro Studios and helped develop <i>Metroid Prime</i> and its sequels for the Gamecube. After a two-year stint at Carbine Studios (working on an MMO game), he decided to get back to his roots and join us here at Valve.</div>
